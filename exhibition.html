                we can see and know about the universe around us. We will locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early 
                navigators who used the stars to travel by.

                For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from 
                and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and 
                understanding our place in this world.

                Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have
                 evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didnt survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, 
                 the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

                For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, 
                thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a 
                look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.

                Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. 
                Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.
